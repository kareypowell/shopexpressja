# Package Distribution Calculation Fix

## Issue Identified
The package distribution calculation had a bug where the outstanding balance was incorrectly calculated when applying customer account balances. 

### Problem
In the screenshot provided, the calculation showed:
- Original Total: $19,901.60
- Cash Collected: $9,901.00
- Account Balance Applied: $10,000.00
- **Outstanding Balance: $10,000.60** ❌ (INCORRECT)

The correct outstanding balance should be: $19,901.60 - $9,901.00 - $10,000.00 = $0.60

## Root Cause
The issue was in the balance application logic in the `PackageDistribution` Livewire component. The code was not properly updating the `$remainingAmount` variable after applying the account balance, which led to incorrect outstanding balance calculations.

## Files Fixed
- `app/Http/Livewire/PackageDistribution.php`

## Methods Updated
1. `updatePaymentStatus()` - Fixed balance application logic
2. `showDistributionConfirmation()` - Fixed distribution summary calculations  
3. `validateDistribution()` - Fixed validation calculations
4. `rules()` - Fixed validation rule calculations

## Changes Made
In all affected methods, added the missing line to update the remaining amount after applying account balance:

```php
// Before (INCORRECT)
if ($this->applyAccountBalance && $this->getCustomerAccountBalanceProperty() > 0 && $remainingAmount > 0) {
    $accountApplied = min($this->getCustomerAccountBalanceProperty(), $remainingAmount);
}

// After (CORRECT)
if ($this->applyAccountBalance && $this->getCustomerAccountBalanceProperty() > 0 && $remainingAmount > 0) {
    $accountApplied = min($this->getCustomerAccountBalanceProperty(), $remainingAmount);
    $remainingAmount -= $accountApplied; // ← This line was missing
}
```

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. Credit balance is applied first (if selected)
2. Cash payment is deducted from remaining amount
3. Account balance is applied to whatever remains (if selected)
4. Outstanding balance is correctly calculated as: Original Total - Cash - Credit Applied - Account Balance Applied

## Expected Result
With the fix, the same scenario from the screenshot should now show:
- Original Total: $19,901.60
- Cash Collected: $9,901.00
- Account Balance Applied: $10,000.00
- **Outstanding Balance: $0.60** ✅ (CORRECT)

## Impact
This fix ensures accurate financial calculations in the package distribution system, preventing discrepancies in customer account balances and outstanding amounts.
