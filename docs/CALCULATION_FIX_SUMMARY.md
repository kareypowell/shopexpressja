# Package Distribution Calculation Fix

## Issue Identified
The package distribution calculation had a bug where the outstanding balance was incorrectly calculated when applying customer account balances. 

### Problem
In the screenshot provided, the calculation showed:
- Original Total: $19,901.60
- Cash Collected: $9,901.00
- Account Balance Applied: $10,000.00
- **Outstanding Balance: $10,000.60** ❌ (INCORRECT)

The correct outstanding balance should be: $19,901.60 - $9,901.00 - $10,000.00 = $0.60

## Root Cause
The issue was in the balance application logic in the `PackageDistribution` Livewire component. The code was not properly updating the `$remainingAmount` variable after applying the account balance, which led to incorrect outstanding balance calculations.

## Files Fixed
- `app/Http/Livewire/PackageDistribution.php`

## Methods Updated
1. `updatePaymentStatus()` - Fixed balance application logic
2. `showDistributionConfirmation()` - Fixed distribution summary calculations  
3. `validateDistribution()` - Fixed validation calculations
4. `rules()` - Fixed validation rule calculations

## Changes Made
In all affected methods, added the missing line to update the remaining amount after applying account balance:

```php
// Before (INCORRECT)
if ($this->applyAccountBalance && $this->getCustomerAccountBalanceProperty() > 0 && $remainingAmount > 0) {
    $accountApplied = min($this->getCustomerAccountBalanceProperty(), $remainingAmount);
}

// After (CORRECT)
if ($this->applyAccountBalance && $this->getCustomerAccountBalanceProperty() > 0 && $remainingAmount > 0) {
    $accountApplied = min($this->getCustomerAccountBalanceProperty(), $remainingAmount);
    $remainingAmount -= $accountApplied; // ← This line was missing
}
```

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. Credit balance is applied first (if selected)
2. Cash payment is deducted from remaining amount
3. Account balance is applied to whatever remains (if selected)
4. Outstanding balance is correctly calculated as: Original Total - Cash - Credit Applied - Account Balance Applied

## Expected Result
With the fix, the same scenario from the screenshot should now show:
- Original Total: $19,901.60
- Cash Collected: $9,901.00
- Account Balance Applied: $10,000.00
- **Outstanding Balance: $0.60** ✅ (CORRECT)

## Impact
This fix ensures accurate financial calculations in the package distribution system, preventing discrepancies in customer account balances and outstanding amounts.

# Additional Calculation Precision Fixes ✅

## Issue Identified
Floating point precision errors in monetary calculations were causing inconsistent payment status calculations and distribution processing issues.

## Root Cause
JavaScript and PHP floating point arithmetic can introduce precision errors when dealing with decimal numbers, leading to:
- Incorrect payment status determinations
- Failed overpayment detection
- Inconsistent monetary calculations

## Files Fixed
- `app/Services/PackageDistributionService.php`
- `app/Http/Livewire/PackageDistribution.php`

## 1. PackageDistributionService.php Fixes

### calculatePackageTotals method:
- ✅ Added proper rounding to 2 decimal places for all individual fee calculations
- ✅ Added rounding for consolidated package totals
- ✅ Added rounding for the final total to prevent floating point precision issues

### Payment transaction handling (both individual and consolidated):
- ✅ Added proper rounding for all monetary values at the start of transaction processing
- ✅ Fixed $totalPaid and $netChargeAmount calculations with proper rounding
- ✅ Fixed $servicePaymentAmount calculation with proper rounding
- ✅ Fixed overpayment calculations with proper rounding and tolerance-based comparison (> 0.01)

### validatePaymentAmount method:
- ✅ Already had proper rounding and tolerance-based comparison (1 cent tolerance)

## 2. PackageDistribution.php (Livewire Component) Fixes

### calculateTotals method:
- ✅ Added proper rounding to 2 decimal places for both individual and consolidated package totals

### updatePaymentStatus method:
- ✅ Already had proper rounding and tolerance-based comparison

### getCalculatedWriteOffAmount method:
- ✅ Already had proper rounding

## Key Improvements Implemented

1. **Consistent Rounding**: All monetary calculations now use `round($value, 2)` to ensure 2 decimal place precision
2. **Tolerance-Based Comparisons**: Overpayment detection now uses `> 0.01` instead of `> 0` to account for floating point precision
3. **Early Rounding**: Values are rounded at the beginning of calculation methods to prevent accumulation of precision errors
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Fixed both individual package and consolidated package distribution calculations

## Code Examples

### Before (Precision Issues):
```php
$totalPaid = $amountCollected + $totalBalanceApplied;
$actualOverpayment = $totalCovered - $totalAmount;
if ($actualOverpayment > 0) { // Could fail due to precision
```

### After (Precision Fixed):
```php
$totalPaid = round($amountCollected + $totalBalanceApplied, 2);
$actualOverpayment = round($totalCovered - $totalAmount, 2);
if ($actualOverpayment > 0.01) { // Tolerance-based comparison
```

## Result

These fixes resolve the calculation precision issues with individual package distributions, ensuring that:
- Payment statuses are calculated correctly
- Monetary values are handled with proper precision throughout the distribution process
- Floating point precision errors are eliminated
- Overpayment detection works reliably with proper tolerance
- All financial calculations maintain 2-decimal precision consistently
