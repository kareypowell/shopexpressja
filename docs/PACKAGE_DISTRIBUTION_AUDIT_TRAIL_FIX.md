# Package Distribution Audit Trail Fix

## Issue Resolved

The package distribution charge was missing from recent transactions when customers paid cash for packages. This created an incomplete audit trail and made it difficult to track package distribution costs in the transaction history.

## Root Cause

The previous implementation only recorded service payments without the corresponding package distribution charges when customers paid the full amount in cash. This resulted in:

- Missing audit trail for package distribution costs
- Incomplete transaction history
- Difficulty tracking what customers were charged for

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Transaction Recording

Modified the `PackageDistributionService` to always record complete transaction pairs:

1. **Package Distribution Charge** - Shows the cost of the package distribution
2. **Payment Transaction** - Shows the payment received to cover the charge
3. **Credit Transaction** - Shows any overpayment converted to credit (if applicable)

### Transaction Flow Examples

#### Scenario 1: Exact Cash Payment
- **Package Cost**: $100
- **Customer Pays**: $100 cash
- **Transactions Created**:
  1. Charge: $100 (balance: 500 → 400)
  2. Payment: $100 (balance: 400 → 500)
- **Final Balance**: $500 (unchanged)

#### Scenario 2: Cash Overpayment  
- **Package Cost**: $100
- **Customer Pays**: $150 cash
- **Transactions Created**:
  1. Charge: $100 (balance: 500 → 400)
  2. Payment: $100 (balance: 400 → 500) 
  3. Credit: $50 (credit balance: 0 → 50)
- **Final Balance**: $500 account + $50 credit

#### Scenario 3: Cash Underpayment
- **Package Cost**: $100  
- **Customer Pays**: $60 cash
- **Transactions Created**:
  1. Charge: $100 (balance: 500 → 400)
  2. Payment: $60 (balance: 400 → 460)
- **Final Balance**: $460 (customer owes $40)
