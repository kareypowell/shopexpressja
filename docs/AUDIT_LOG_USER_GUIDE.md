## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: I can't see the Audit Logs menu item**
A: Ensure you have Super Admin role. Contact your system administrator if needed.

**Q: Export is taking too long**
A: Reduce the date range or add more specific filters to limit results.

**Q: Some entries show "Unknown User"**
A: This occurs for system-generated events or when user accounts have been deleted.

**Q: I can't find specific activities**
A: Check that the date range includes when the activity occurred. Some events may be categorized differently than expected.

### Performance Tips

- Use specific date ranges rather than "All Time"
- Apply multiple filters to narrow results
- Export smaller datasets for faster processing
- Use bookmarks for frequently accessed filter combinations

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring

- Review security events weekly
- Monitor failed login attempts daily
- Check for unusual activity patterns
- Export monthly compliance reports

### Filter Strategies

- Start with broad filters, then narrow down
- Use date ranges to focus on specific incidents
- Combine user and action filters for targeted searches
- Save frequently used filter combinations as bookmarks

### Documentation

- Export relevant logs for incident documentation
- Include audit evidence in security reports
- Maintain compliance documentation with regular exports
- Document any security incidents with supporting audit data
