# Manifest Lock/Unlock Functionality

## Overview

Successfully implemented the ability to manually lock (close) manifests after unlocking them for editing. This completes the manifest locking workflow by allowing users to:

1. **Unlock** a closed manifest to make edits (existing functionality)
2. **Lock** an open manifest when finished editing (new functionality)

## New Features Added

### 1. ManifestLockService Enhancement

**File:** `app/Services/ManifestLockService.php`

- Added `lockManifest()` public method for manually closing manifests
- Validates lock reason (10-500 characters)
- Checks user permissions (must have 'edit' permission)
- Creates audit trail with 'closed' action
- Returns success/error response with appropriate messages

### 2. ManifestLockStatus Component Enhancement

**File:** `app/Http/Livewire/Manifests/ManifestLockStatus.php`

- Added lock modal functionality (`showLockModal`, `lockReason` properties)
- Added `showLockModal()`, `lockManifest()`, `cancelLock()` methods
- Added validation rules for lock reason
- Emits `manifestLocked` event on successful lock

### 3. Template Enhancement

**File:** `resources/views/livewire/manifests/manifest-lock-status.blade.php`

- Added "Lock Manifest" button for open manifests
- Added lock modal with reason input and validation
- Proper visual styling with red theme for lock operations
- Consistent UX with unlock functionality

## User Experience

### For Open Manifests
- Shows "Editing Enabled" status with green badge
- Displays "Lock Manifest" button (red) next to status
- Clicking opens modal requiring reason for locking

### For Closed Manifests  
- Shows "Locked - View Only" status with gray badge
- Displays "Unlock Manifest" button (blue) 
- Existing unlock functionality unchanged

### Lock Modal Features
- Requires 10-500 character reason
- Real-time character counter
- Form validation with error messages
- Warning notice about locking consequences
- Cancel/Lock action buttons

## Security & Permissions

- **Lock Permission**: Uses existing 'edit' permission check
- **Unlock Permission**: Uses existing 'unlock' permission check
- **Audit Trail**: All lock/unlock operations logged with user, reason, timestamp
- **Validation**: Server-side validation prevents bypassing UI restrictions

## Testing

**File:** `tests/Feature/ManifestLockFunctionalityTest.php`

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- ✅ Lock open manifest with valid reason
- ✅ Prevent locking already closed manifest
- ✅ Validate lock reason length requirements
- ✅ Show appropriate buttons based on manifest state
- ✅ Lock modal functionality
- ✅ Component lock/unlock workflow
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Audit trail creation
- ✅ Permission enforcement

**Test Results:** All 11 tests passing ✅

## API Methods

### ManifestLockService::lockManifest()

```php
public function lockManifest(Manifest $manifest, User $user, string $reason): array
```

**Parameters:**
- `$manifest`: The manifest to lock
- `$user`: User performing the action
- `$reason`: Reason for locking (10-500 chars)

**Returns:**
```php
[
    'success' => bool,
    'message' => string
]
```

**Validation:**
- Manifest must be open
- User must have 'edit' permission
- Reason must be 10-500 characters

## Workflow Integration

The lock functionality integrates seamlessly with the existing manifest workflow:

1. **Create Manifest** → Open state
2. **Edit Packages** → Remains open
3. **Lock Manifest** → Closed state (new functionality)
4. **Unlock if Needed** → Open state (existing functionality)
5. **Re-lock When Done** → Closed state (new functionality)

## Benefits

- **Complete Workflow**: Users can now properly close manifests after editing
- **Audit Compliance**: All lock/unlock operations are logged
- **User Control**: Admins have full control over manifest state
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental edits to completed manifests
- **Consistent UX**: Lock functionality mirrors unlock functionality

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Auto-lock after period of inactivity
- Bulk lock/unlock operations
- Lock scheduling
- Advanced permission granularity
- Lock reason templates
