# Granular Balance Control Implementation

## Overview

Enhanced the package distribution system to provide granular control over which customer balances to apply during package distribution. Users can now choose to apply:

1. **Credit balance only**
2. **Account balance only** 
3. **Both credit and account balance**
4. **Neither balance** (cash payment only)

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Layer Updates

#### PackageDistributionService.php
- **Modified method signature**: Changed from `bool $applyCreditBalance` to `array $balanceOptions`
- **New balance options structure**:
  ```php
  $balanceOptions = [
      'credit' => true,   // Apply credit balance
      'account' => true,  // Apply account balance
  ];
  ```
- **Backward compatibility**: Added support for old boolean parameter format
- **Enhanced logic**: Credit balance is applied first, then account balance if needed
- **Added legacy method**: `distributePackagesLegacy()` for backward compatibility

### 2. UI Component Updates

#### PackageDistribution.php (Livewire)
- **New properties**:
  - `$applyCreditBalance` - Controls credit balance application
  - `$applyAccountBalance` - Controls account balance application
- **Updated distribution call**: Converts UI selections to new balance options format
- **Enhanced payment status calculation**: Accounts for separate balance applications

#### package-distribution.blade.php
- **Replaced single checkbox** with separate options for each balance type
- **Dynamic display**: Shows only available balance types
- **Enhanced summary**: Displays credit and account balance applications separately
- **Visual improvements**: Different colors for different balance types (blue for credit, green for account)

### 3. Balance Application Logic

#### Priority Order
1. **Credit balance** (applied first if selected)
2. **Account balance** (applied to remaining amount if selected)
3. **Cash payment** (covers service cost directly)
4. **Unpaid amount** (charged to customer account if insufficient funds)

#### Examples

**Scenario 1: Credit Balance Only**
- Customer: $500 account + $200 credit
- Package: $150
- Selection: Credit only
- Result: Credit reduced to $50, account unchanged at $500

**Scenario 2: Account Balance Only**
- Customer: $500 account + $200 credit  
- Package: $150
- Selection: Account only
- Result: Account reduced to $350, credit unchanged at $200

**Scenario 3: Both Balances**
- Customer: $500 account + $50 credit
- Package: $150
- Selection: Both
- Result: Credit used fully ($50), account reduced by $100 to $400

## UI Improvements

### Before
```
☑ Apply customer available balance ($700.00)
    Account: $500.00 + Credit: $200.00
```

### After
```
Apply Customer Balance

☑ Apply credit balance ($200.00)
☑ Apply account balance ($500.00)
    Total available: $700.00
```

### Summary Display
- **Credit Applied**: $200.00 (blue)
- **Account Balance Applied**: $100.00 (green)
- **Cash Collected**: $50.00

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Coverage
1. **GranularBalanceControlTest.php** - Tests all balance combination scenarios
2. **PackageDistributionUITest.php** - Tests UI component behavior
3. **BalanceCalculationScenariosTest.php** - Tests various payment scenarios
4. **SimbaPowell_BalanceCalculationTest.php** - Tests the original issue fix

### Test Scenarios Covered
- Credit balance only usage
- Account balance only usage
- Combined balance usage
- Balance priority handling
- Insufficient balance scenarios
- Cash + balance combinations
- UI state management
- Backward compatibility

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Clear control** over which balances to use
- **Flexible payment options** for different customer preferences
- **Transparent display** of how balances are applied
- **Better financial management** with separate balance tracking

### For Business
- **Accurate balance tracking** prevents confusion
- **Improved customer experience** with clear payment options
- **Better financial reporting** with separate balance categories
- **Reduced support issues** from balance calculation confusion

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains full backward compatibility:
- Old API calls with boolean parameter still work
- Existing integrations continue to function
- Legacy method available for transition period
- All existing tests pass without modification

## Migration Path

### For API Users
```php
// Old way (still works)
$service->distributePackages($packages, $amount, $user, true);

// New way (recommended)
$service->distributePackages($packages, $amount, $user, [
    'credit' => true,
    'account' => true
]);
```

### For UI Users
- Existing functionality preserved
- Enhanced options available in advanced settings
- Intuitive checkbox interface
- Clear visual feedback

## Future Enhancements

1. **Preset balance preferences** per customer
2. **Balance application rules** based on package type
3. **Automatic balance optimization** suggestions
4. **Balance usage analytics** and reporting
5. **Mobile-optimized balance selection** interface

This implementation provides the granular control requested while maintaining system stability and user experience.
