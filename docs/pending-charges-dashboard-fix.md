# Pending Charges Dashboard Fix

## Problem Identified

After fixing the double-charging issue, customers could no longer see what they owed for their ready packages in their dashboard. The balance showed $0.00 even when they had expensive packages ready for pickup.

**Example**: Simba Powell had 2 ready packages worth $14,510.00 total, but his dashboard showed:
- Account Balance: $0.00
- Credit Balance: $0.00
- Total Available: $0.00

This created a **user experience problem** where customers couldn't see their pending financial obligations.

## Root Cause

The original system charged customers when packages were set to "ready" status, so the account balance reflected what they owed. After removing the double-charging, customers were only charged during distribution, but the dashboard didn't show pending charges for ready packages.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added New User Model Methods

Added four new methods to `app/Models/User.php`:

```php
/**
 * Get total cost of ready packages (pending charges)
 */
public function getPendingPackageChargesAttribute()
{
    return $this->packages()
        ->where('status', 'ready')
        ->sum(\DB::raw('freight_price + customs_duty + storage_fee + delivery_fee'));
}

/**
 * Get formatted pending package charges
 */
public function getFormattedPendingPackageChargesAttribute()
{
    return number_format($this->pending_package_charges, 2);
}

/**
 * Get total amount customer needs to pay to collect all ready packages
 * This includes current debt minus available balance plus pending charges
 */
public function getTotalAmountNeededAttribute()
{
    $currentDebt = $this->account_balance < 0 ? abs($this->account_balance) : 0;
    $availableCredit = $this->credit_balance;
    $pendingCharges = $this->pending_package_charges;
    
    // Total needed = current debt + pending charges - available credit
    $totalNeeded = $currentDebt + $pendingCharges - $availableCredit;
    
    return max(0, $totalNeeded); // Never show negative amount needed
}

/**
 * Get formatted total amount needed
 */
public function getFormattedTotalAmountNeededAttribute()
{
    return number_format($this->total_amount_needed, 2);
}
```

### 2. Updated Dashboard Component

Modified `app/Http/Livewire/Dashboard.php` to include the new properties:

```php
public float $pendingPackageCharges = 0;
public float $totalAmountNeeded = 0;

// In mount() method:
$this->pendingPackageCharges = $user->pending_package_charges;
$this->totalAmountNeeded = $user->total_amount_needed;
```

### 3. Enhanced Dashboard View

Updated `resources/views/livewire/quick-insights.blade.php` to display:

- **Pending Charges**: Shows total cost of ready packages
- **Available Balance**: Renamed from "Total Available" for clarity
- **Amount Needed to Collect All**: Highlighted section showing total payment needed

### 4. Updated Demo Command

Enhanced `app/Console/Commands/DemoPackageDistribution.php` to show pending charges information.

## How It Works

### Calculation Logic

The `total_amount_needed` calculation considers:

1. **Current Debt**: If account balance is negative (customer owes money)
2. **Pending Charges**: Total cost of all ready packages
3. **Available Credit**: Credit balance that can be applied

**Formula**: `max(0, current_debt + pending_charges - available_credit)`

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Customer with Ready Packages (No Existing Balance)
- Account Balance: $0.00
- Pending Charges: $14,510.00
- **Amount Needed**: $14,510.00

#### Scenario 2: Customer with Debt and Ready Packages
- Account Balance: -$100.00 (owes $100)
- Pending Charges: $14,510.00
- **Amount Needed**: $14,610.00

#### Scenario 3: Customer with Credit and Ready Packages
- Account Balance: $0.00
- Credit Balance: $200.00
- Pending Charges: $14,510.00
- **Amount Needed**: $14,310.00

#### Scenario 4: Customer with Sufficient Credit
- Account Balance: $0.00
- Credit Balance: $15,000.00
- Pending Charges: $14,510.00
- **Amount Needed**: $0.00 (credit covers all packages)

## Dashboard Display

The updated dashboard now shows:

```
Account Balance
â”œâ”€â”€ Account: $0.00
â”œâ”€â”€ Credit: $200.00 (if > 0)
â”œâ”€â”€ Pending Charges: $14,510.00 (if > 0)
â”œâ”€â”€ Available Balance: $200.00
â””â”€â”€ Amount Needed to Collect All: $14,310.00 (highlighted)
```
