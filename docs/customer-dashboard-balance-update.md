# Customer Dashboard Balance Update

## Overview
Updated the customer dashboard to display comprehensive account balance information instead of just a single "Account Balance" value.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard Component Updates (`app/Http/Livewire/Dashboard.php`)
- Added new properties for `creditBalance` and `totalAvailableBalance`
- Updated `mount()` method to get actual user account balances instead of calculating package costs
- Now uses `auth()->user()->account_balance`, `credit_balance`, and `total_available_balance`

### 2. Quick Insights View Updates (`resources/views/livewire/quick-insights.blade.php`)
- Enhanced the Account Balance section to show:
  - **Account Balance**: Main account balance (can be negative if customer owes money)
  - **Credit Balance**: Available credit from overpayments (only shown if > 0)
  - **Total Available**: Combined balance available for use
- Added color coding:
  - Green for positive account balance, red for negative
  - Blue for credit balance
  - Purple for total available balance

### 3. Dashboard View Updates (`resources/views/livewire/dashboard.blade.php`)
- Added detailed `CustomerAccountBalance` component for customers
- Passes all balance variables to the quick-insights partial
- Provides comprehensive balance information with transaction history

## Before vs After

### Before:
```
Account Balance
$42,470.41
```

### After:
```
Account Balance
Account:        $150.75
Credit:         $25.50
Total Available: $176.25
```

Plus a detailed account balance section below with:
- Visual balance cards for each balance type
- Balance explanations
- Recent transaction history (toggleable)

## Features Added

### Quick Insights Section:
- **Account Balance**: Shows current account balance with appropriate color coding
- **Credit Balance**: Shows available credit (only if customer has credit)
- **Total Available**: Shows combined balance available for charges

### Detailed Balance Section:
- **Visual Cards**: Separate cards for each balance type with icons
- **Balance Information**: Explanations of what each balance means
- **Transaction History**: Recent transactions with toggle functionality
- **Transaction Details**: Shows type, amount, date, and who made the change

## Benefits

1. **Clear Financial Picture**: Customers can see exactly what they owe vs what credit they have
2. **Credit Visibility**: Customers can see available credit from overpayments
3. **Total Available**: Shows combined purchasing power
4. **Transaction Transparency**: Full history of account changes
5. **Professional Presentation**: Modern, clean interface with proper color coding

## Technical Implementation

### Balance Calculations:
- **Account Balance**: Direct from `users.account_balance` column
- **Credit Balance**: Direct from `users.credit_balance` column  
- **Total Available**: Calculated as `account_balance + credit_balance`

### Color Coding Logic:
```php
// Account balance: green if positive, red if negative
{{ $accountBalance >= 0 ? 'text-green-600' : 'text-red-600' }}

// Credit balance: always blue (represents available credit)
text-blue-600

// Total available: purple (represents total purchasing power)
text-purple-600
```

### Component Integration:
- Uses existing `CustomerAccountBalance` Livewire component
- Integrates seamlessly with existing dashboard layout
- Maintains responsive design for mobile devices

## Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests for the `CustomerAccountBalance` component
- Tests verify balance display, transaction toggling, and customer-specific data
- All tests passing (3/3)

## Future Enhancements
- Add balance trend indicators (up/down arrows)
- Include balance change notifications
- Add quick payment/credit application buttons
- Integrate with payment processing for online top-ups
