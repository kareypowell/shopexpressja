# Consolidation Performance Optimizations

## Overview

This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented for the package consolidation feature to ensure efficient operation with large datasets.

## 1. Database Indexes

### Added Performance Indexes

**consolidated_packages table:**
- `idx_consolidated_customer_active_status` - Composite index for customer queries with active status
- `idx_consolidated_tracking_number` - Index for search queries on tracking number
- `idx_consolidated_date_active` - Index for date-based queries
- `idx_consolidated_status_active` - Index for status-based filtering

**packages table:**
- `idx_packages_consolidated_user` - Composite index for consolidated package queries
- `idx_packages_user_consolidated_status` - Index for consolidation eligibility queries
- `idx_packages_consolidated_tracking` - Index for search queries within consolidated packages
- `idx_packages_consolidated_totals` - Index for consolidated package totals calculation

**consolidation_history table:**
- `idx_history_package_date_action` - Composite index for history queries by package and date
- `idx_history_user_date` - Index for user-based history queries
- `idx_history_action_date` - Index for action-based filtering

### Migration File
- `database/migrations/2025_08_15_000001_add_consolidation_performance_indexes.php`

## 2. Eager Loading Optimizations

### Enhanced Model Relationships

**ConsolidatedPackage Model:**
- Added `packagesWithDetails()` relationship with optimized field selection
- Added `withEssentials()` scope for loading with essential relationships only
- Added `forDashboard()` scope for dashboard queries with minimal data
- Optimized search scope with full-text capabilities

**Package Model:**
- Added `forConsolidation()` scope for consolidated package queries with minimal data
- Enhanced `availableForConsolidation()` scope with optimized field selection

### Query Optimizations
- Selective field loading to reduce memory usage
- Proper relationship eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Optimized search queries with subqueries to avoid performance issues

## 3. Caching Implementation

### ConsolidationCacheService

**Cache Categories:**
- **Consolidated Totals** - Caches calculated totals to avoid repeated calculations
- **Customer Consolidations** - Caches active consolidations per customer
- **Available Packages** - Caches packages available for consolidation
- **Consolidation Statistics** - Caches system-wide consolidation metrics
- **Search Results** - Caches search query results

**Cache Durations:**
- Short (15 minutes) - For frequently changing data
- Normal (60 minutes) - For standard operations
- Long (240 minutes) - For stable statistical data

**Cache Invalidation:**
- Automatic cache invalidation on consolidation operations
- Customer-specific cache invalidation
- Granular cache key management

### Integration with Services

**PackageConsolidationService:**
- Updated to use caching service for data retrieval
- Automatic cache invalidation on consolidation/unconsolidation
- Optimized data loading with eager loading

## 4. Search Query Optimizations

### Enhanced Search Functionality

**ConsolidatedPackage Model:**
- `searchOptimized()` scope with full-text capabilities
- Subquery optimization for package matches
- Limited result sets to prevent memory issues
- Optimized match highlighting with field selection

**Performance Features:**
- Indexed search fields for fast lookups
- Cached search results for repeated queries
- Memory-efficient result loading

## 5. Performance Testing
