  - [ ] Migration files in `database/migrations/`
  - [ ] Seeder files in `database/seeders/`

### 2. Database Migration
- [ ] Run audit system migrations:
  ```bash
  php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_09_20_182606_create_audit_logs_table.php
  php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_09_20_182648_create_audit_settings_table.php
  php artisan migrate --path=database/migrations/2025_09_21_000001_add_audit_performance_indexes.php
  ```
- [ ] Verify tables created successfully:
  - [ ] `audit_logs` table exists
  - [ ] `audit_settings` table exists
  - [ ] Indexes are properly created
- [ ] Check migration status: `php artisan migrate:status`

### 3. Configuration Setup
- [ ] Add audit environment variables to `.env` file
- [ ] Create `config/audit.php` configuration file
- [ ] Seed initial audit settings: `php artisan db:seed --class=AuditSystemSeeder`
- [ ] Verify configuration: `php artisan config:cache`

### 4. Queue Configuration
- [ ] Configure Redis/database queue connection
- [ ] Set up supervisor configuration for audit queue workers
- [ ] Start queue workers: `supervisorctl start audit-queue-worker:*`
- [ ] Verify queue workers are running: `php artisan queue:monitor`

### 5. Cron Job Setup
- [ ] Install audit maintenance cron jobs
- [ ] Configure log rotation for audit logs
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting cron jobs
- [ ] Test cron job execution

### 6. Permission Configuration
- [ ] Verify Super Admin role has audit log access
- [ ] Test audit log menu visibility for different user roles
- [ ] Confirm policy-based access control is working
- [ ] Test audit log viewing permissions

## Post-Deployment Verification
