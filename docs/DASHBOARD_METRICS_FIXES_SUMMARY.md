# Dashboard Analytics Service Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Customer Metrics - Admin User Exclusion
**Problem**: Customer metrics were including admin and staff users in counts
**Fix**: Modified `getCustomerMetrics()` to only count users with `role_id = 3` (customers)
**Location**: `app/Services/DashboardAnalyticsService.php` lines 30-40

### 2. Package Status Enum Values
**Problem**: Package queries were using hardcoded string values instead of PackageStatus enum
**Fix**: Updated `getShipmentMetrics()` to use `PackageStatus::PENDING`, `PackageStatus::PROCESSING`, etc.
**Location**: `app/Services/DashboardAnalyticsService.php` lines 70-90

### 3. Financial Metrics - Customer Transaction Focus
**Problem**: Financial metrics were including all transactions, not just customer-related ones
**Fix**: Modified `getFinancialMetrics()` to:
- Only count transactions from users with `role_id = 3` (customers)
- Exclude credit transactions from revenue calculations
- Focus on actual customer payments and charges
**Location**: `app/Services/DashboardAnalyticsService.php` lines 110-140

### 4. Missing Database Import
**Problem**: Missing `DB` facade import for raw database queries
**Fix**: Added `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;` import
**Location**: `app/Services/DashboardAnalyticsService.php` line 9

## Key Changes Made

1. **Customer Query Filter**: 
   ```php
   // Before: User::query()
   // After: User::where('role_id', 3)
   ```

2. **Package Status Enum Usage**:
   ```php
   // Before: ->where('status', 'pending')
   // After: ->where('status', PackageStatus::PENDING)
   ```

3. **Financial Metrics Customer Focus**:
   ```php
   // Added customer role filter to all financial queries
   ->whereHas('user', function($query) {
       $query->where('role_id', 3);
   })
   ```

4. **Revenue Calculation**:
   ```php
   // Exclude credit transactions from revenue
   ->whereNotIn('type', [CustomerTransaction::TYPE_CREDIT])
   ```

## Tests Created

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/Feature/DashboardMetricsFixTest.php` covering:
- Customer metrics excluding admin users
- Package metrics using correct enum values  
- Financial metrics using actual customer transactions
- Financial metrics excluding admin transactions

## Verification

All tests pass, confirming:
- ✅ Customer metrics only count role_id = 3 users
- ✅ Package metrics use PackageStatus enum values
- ✅ Financial metrics focus on customer transactions
- ✅ Admin/staff transactions are excluded from revenue

## Impact

These fixes ensure that dashboard analytics provide accurate business metrics by:
- Separating customer data from internal user data
- Using consistent enum values for package statuses
- Focusing financial metrics on actual customer revenue
- Providing reliable data for business decision making
