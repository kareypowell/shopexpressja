# Receipt Write-off Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the receipt generation system to clearly display whether write-offs were applied as fixed amounts or percentages, providing complete transparency for customers and audit purposes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Changes
- **Migration**: Added `write_off_reason` column to `package_distributions` table
- **Model**: Updated `PackageDistribution` model to include `write_off_reason` in fillable fields
- **Storage**: Write-off reasons now stored directly in distribution records

### 2. Backend Service Updates

#### PackageDistributionService
- Updated both `distributePackages()` and `distributeConsolidatedPackages()` methods
- Enhanced write-off reason formatting to include type information
- Store formatted reasons in database for audit trail

#### ReceiptGeneratorService  
- Added `write_off_reason` to receipt data formatting
- Maintains existing receipt structure while adding transparency

### 3. Frontend Enhancements

#### Livewire Component
- Enhanced write-off reason formatting with type detection
- Automatic appending of discount type information:
  - Fixed amounts: "(Fixed amount discount)"
  - Percentages: "(X% discount = $Y.YY)"

### 4. Receipt Template Updates

#### Individual Package Receipts (`package-distribution.blade.php`)
- Added write-off reason display below discount amount
- Styled as italic, smaller text for clarity
- Only shows when reason exists

#### Consolidated Package Receipts (`consolidated-package-distribution.blade.php`)
- Same enhancement as individual receipts
- Consistent formatting across all receipt types

### 5. Receipt Examples

#### Fixed Amount Write-off
```
Payment Summary:
├── Subtotal: $100.00
├── Total Amount: $100.00
├── Cash Collected: $75.00
├── Discount/Write-off: -$25.00
│   └── Reason: Customer loyalty discount (Fixed amount discount)
└── Total Paid: $100.00
```

#### Percentage Write-off
```
Payment Summary:
├── Subtotal: $100.00
├── Total Amount: $100.00
├── Cash Collected: $80.00
├── Discount/Write-off: -$20.00
│   └── Reason: Customer loyalty discount (20% discount = $20.00)
└── Total Paid: $100.00
```

## Technical Implementation

### Write-off Reason Formatting Logic
```php
// In PackageDistribution Livewire Component
$writeOffReason = $this->writeOffReason;
if ($this->writeOffType === 'percentage') {
    $writeOffReason .= " ({$this->writeOffPercentage}% discount = $" . number_format($calculatedWriteOff, 2) . ")";
} else {
    $writeOffReason .= " (Fixed amount discount)";
}
```

### Database Storage
```php
// In PackageDistributionService
$distribution = PackageDistribution::create([
    // ... other fields
    'write_off_amount' => $writeOffAmount,
    'write_off_reason' => $options['writeOffReason'] ?? null,
    // ... other fields
]);
```

### Receipt Template Enhancement
```blade
@if($write_off_amount > 0)
<table class="summary-row">
    <tr>
        <td class="summary-label">Discount/Write-off:</td>
        <td class="summary-amount">-${{ $write_off_amount }}</td>
    </tr>
</table>
@if($write_off_reason)
<table class="summary-row">
    <tr>
        <td class="summary-label" style="font-size: 12px; color: #6b7280; font-style: italic;">Reason:</td>
        <td class="summary-amount" style="font-size: 12px; color: #6b7280; font-style: italic; text-align: right;">{{ $write_off_reason }}</td>
    </tr>
</table>
@endif
@endif
```

## Benefits

## Backward Compatibility

- New write-off reason field is nullable
- Receipt templates gracefully handle missing reasons
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing Verification
- Database migration successful
- Model fillable fields updated
- Column exists in database
- Write-off reason formatting logic tested
- Receipt templates render correctly

## Files Modified
