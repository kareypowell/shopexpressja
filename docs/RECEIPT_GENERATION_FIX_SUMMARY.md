# Receipt Generation Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

The generated PDF receipts were missing customer names and didn't include the enhanced balance information (credit applied, account balance applied) that was added to the package distribution system.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Customer Names
- **Problem**: Receipt generator was trying to access `$distribution->customer->name` 
- **Issue**: User model doesn't have a `name` attribute - it has `first_name` and `last_name`
- **Solution**: Changed to use `$distribution->customer->full_name` which uses the `getFullNameAttribute()` method

### 2. Missing Distributed By Names  
- **Problem**: Same issue with `$distribution->distributedBy->name`
- **Solution**: Changed to use `$distribution->distributedBy->full_name`

### 3. Outdated Receipt Template
- **Problem**: Receipt template didn't show the new balance fields (credit applied, account balance applied, write-off amounts)
- **Solution**: Enhanced template to show complete payment breakdown

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ReceiptGeneratorService.php Updates

#### Customer Name Fix
```php
// Before
'name' => $distribution->customer->name,

// After  
'name' => $distribution->customer->full_name,
```

#### Distributed By Name Fix
```php
// Before
'name' => $distribution->distributedBy->name,

// After
'name' => $distribution->distributedBy->full_name,
```

### 2. Enhanced Receipt Template

#### Updated Payment Breakdown Section
```php
// Before - Simple breakdown
<tr>
    <td class="label">Amount Collected:</td>
    <td class="amount">${{ $amount_collected }}</td>
</tr>

// After - Detailed breakdown
<tr>
    <td class="label">Cash Collected:</td>
    <td class="amount">${{ $amount_collected }}</td>
</tr>
@if($credit_applied > 0)
<tr>
    <td class="label">Credit Applied:</td>
    <td class="amount">${{ $credit_applied }}</td>
</tr>
@endif
@if($account_balance_applied > 0)
<tr>
    <td class="label">Account Balance Applied:</td>
    <td class="amount">${{ $account_balance_applied }}</td>
</tr>
@endif
@if($write_off_amount > 0)
<tr>
    <td class="label">Discount/Write-off:</td>
    <td class="amount">-${{ $write_off_amount }}</td>
</tr>
@endif
<tr>
    <td class="label">Total Paid:</td>
    <td class="amount">${{ $total_paid }}</td>
</tr>
```
