## Monitoring

### Email Status Tracking
- `email_sent` boolean flag
- `email_sent_at` timestamp
- Failed email logging

### Performance Monitoring
- Queue processing metrics
- Email delivery success rates
- PDF generation performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not sent**
   - Check queue processing: `php artisan queue:work`
   - Verify email configuration
   - Check receipt file exists on public disk

2. **PDF not attached / Receipt file not found**
   - **Fixed Issue**: Receipt files are stored on `public` disk (`storage/app/public/receipts/`)
   - Email service now correctly checks `Storage::disk('public')->exists()`
   - PDF attachment uses `Storage::disk('public')->path()`

3. **Email content missing data**
   - Check distribution items are properly loaded
   - Verify package relationships
   - Validate totals calculation

### Storage Configuration

**Important**: Receipt files are stored on the `public` disk:
- **File Location**: `storage/app/public/receipts/`
- **Receipt Generator**: Uses `Storage::disk('public')->put()`
- **Email Service**: Uses `Storage::disk('public')->exists()`
- **PDF Attachment**: Uses `Storage::disk('public')->path()`

### Retry Failed Emails

Use the built-in Artisan command to retry failed distribution emails:

```bash
# Retry specific distribution by ID
php artisan distribution:retry-emails --id=5

# Retry all failed emails
php artisan distribution:retry-emails --failed

# Retry all emails (with confirmation)
php artisan distribution:retry-emails --all
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check queue status
php artisan queue:work --verbose

# Check failed jobs
php artisan queue:failed

# Retry failed jobs
php artisan queue:retry all

# Check if receipt files exist
ls -la storage/app/public/receipts/

# Retry specific failed distribution email
php artisan distribution:retry-emails --id=DISTRIBUTION_ID
```
