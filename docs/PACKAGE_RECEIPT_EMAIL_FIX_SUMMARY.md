# Package Receipt Email Fix

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Package receipt emails were failing with the error:
```
A non well formed numeric value encountered (View: /Users/kareypowell/Code/shs-client/resources/views/emails/packages/receipt.blade.php) at line 382: number_format('7,942.00', 2)
```

**Root Cause**: The `ReceiptGeneratorService::calculateTotals()` method was returning already formatted strings with commas (e.g., `'7,942.00'`), but the email template was trying to format them again with `number_format()`. The `number_format()` function expects numeric values, not formatted strings.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified PackageReceiptEmail Class
**Location**: `app/Mail/PackageReceiptEmail.php`

**Changes**:
- Replaced the call to `ReceiptGeneratorService::calculateTotals()` with a new `calculateRawTotals()` method
- Added `calculateRawTotals()` method that returns raw numeric values instead of formatted strings
- This allows the email template to properly format the numbers using `number_format()`

### 2. Key Code Changes

**Before**:
```php
// Get totals from ReceiptGeneratorService for consistency
$this->totals = $receiptGenerator->calculateTotals($distribution);
```

**After**:
```php
// Get raw numeric totals for email template (will be formatted in template)
$this->totals = $this->calculateRawTotals($distribution);
```

**New Method Added**:
```php
private function calculateRawTotals(PackageDistribution $distribution): array
{
    // Returns raw numeric values instead of formatted strings
    return [
        'total_amount' => $distribution->total_amount,
        'amount_collected' => $distribution->amount_collected,
        // ... other numeric values
    ];
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Email Rendering**: Package receipt emails now render correctly without number format errors
2. **Proper Formatting**: Numbers are formatted consistently in the email template using `number_format()`
3. **Error Prevention**: Prevents future issues with double-formatting of numeric values
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between PDF generation (formatted strings) and email generation (raw numbers)

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/Unit/PackageReceiptEmailTest.php`:
- ✅ Email can be rendered without number format errors
- ✅ Large amounts are handled correctly
- ✅ Numeric values are properly formatted in the template
- ✅ Email content contains expected formatted values

## Impact

- Package distribution emails will now be sent successfully
- Customers will receive proper receipt emails with correctly formatted amounts
