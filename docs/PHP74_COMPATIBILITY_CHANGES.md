# PHP 7.4 Compatibility Changes

This document outlines the changes made to ensure the Security Monitoring and Alerting system is compatible with PHP 7.4.

## Changes Made

### 1. Typed Properties → DocBlock Types

**Before (PHP 7.4+ typed properties):**
```php
protected SecurityMonitoringService $securityService;
protected AuditService $auditService;
protected array $alertData;
```

**After (PHP 7.4 compatible with DocBlocks):**
```php
/** @var SecurityMonitoringService */
protected $securityService;

/** @var AuditService */
protected $auditService;

/** @var array */
protected $alertData;
```

### 2. Match Expressions → Switch Statements

**Before (PHP 8+ match expressions):**
```php
$riskScore = match ($anomaly['severity']) {
    'critical' => 95,
    'high' => 80,
    'medium' => 60,
    'low' => 30,
    default => 25
};
```

**After (PHP 7.4 compatible switch statements):**
```php
switch ($anomaly['severity']) {
    case 'critical':
        $riskScore = 95;
        break;
    case 'high':
        $riskScore = 80;
        break;
    case 'medium':
        $riskScore = 60;
        break;
    case 'low':
        $riskScore = 30;
        break;
    default:
        $riskScore = 25;
        break;
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **app/Http/Livewire/Admin/SecurityDashboard.php**
   - Converted typed properties to DocBlock annotations
   - Replaced match expression with switch statement in `generateAnomalyAlert()`

2. **app/Console/Commands/SecurityAnomalyDetectionCommand.php**
   - Converted typed property to DocBlock annotation
   - Replaced match expression with switch statement in `calculateRiskScore()`

3. **app/Notifications/SecurityAlertNotification.php**
   - Converted typed property to DocBlock annotation
   - Replaced match expressions with switch statements in:
     - `getSubjectByRiskLevel()`
     - `getPriorityByRiskLevel()`

4. **app/Http/Middleware/SecurityMonitoringMiddleware.php**
   - Converted typed properties to DocBlock annotations

5. **app/Listeners/SecurityMonitoringListener.php**
   - Converted typed properties to DocBlock annotations

## Compatibility Verification

All changes have been tested and verified to work correctly with PHP 7.4:

- ✅ Syntax validation passed for all files
- ✅ Unit tests pass successfully
- ✅ Security monitoring functionality works as expected
- ✅ Anomaly detection command executes properly
- ✅ Alert generation and notification system functional

## Features Maintained

All original functionality has been preserved:

- Risk scoring and level calculation
- Security alert generation and notification
- System anomaly detection
- User activity monitoring
- IP-based activity analysis
- Dashboard functionality
- Command-line anomaly detection

## PHP Version Requirements

- **Minimum PHP Version**: 7.4.0
- **Recommended PHP Version**: 7.4.33 (latest 7.4.x)
- **Laravel Compatibility**: Laravel 8.x with PHP 7.4+

## Notes

- All type hints for method parameters and return types remain unchanged as they are supported in PHP 7.4
- DocBlock type annotations provide IDE support while maintaining PHP 7.4 compatibility
- Switch statements provide the same functionality as match expressions with explicit break statements
- No performance impact from these changes
