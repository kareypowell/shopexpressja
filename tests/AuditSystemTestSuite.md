#### 4. AuditLogRetrievalTest (`tests/Feature/AuditLogRetrievalTest.php`)
Tests for audit log querying and retrieval functionality:

- **Access control**: Validates proper authorization for audit log access

- **Search functionality**: Validates text search across audit log fields
- **Relationship loading**: Tests proper loading of related models
- **Complex queries**: Validates advanced query combinations
- **Pagination**: Tests pagination of large audit log datasets
- **JSON field searching**: Validates searching within JSON data fields
- **Statistics generation**: Tests audit statistics and summary generation

#### 5. SecurityMonitoringIntegrationTest (`tests/Feature/SecurityMonitoringIntegrationTest.php`)
Integration tests for security monitoring features:

- **Authentication monitoring**: Tests integration with authentication events
- **Suspicious pattern detection**: Validates detection of attack patterns
- **System-wide monitoring**: Tests comprehensive security monitoring
- **Alert generation**: Validates security alert creation and distribution
- **Audit trail integration**: Tests integration between audit and security systems
- **Performance monitoring**: Tests handling of high-volume security events
- **Dashboard metrics**: Validates security dashboard data generation

### Browser Tests

#### 6. AuditLogManagementTest (`tests/Browser/AuditLogManagementTest.php`)
End-to-end browser tests for the administrative interface:

- **Interface access control**: Tests proper authorization for admin interface
- **Data display**: Validates proper rendering of audit log data
- **Search and filtering**: Tests interactive search and filter functionality
- **Sorting and pagination**: Validates table sorting and pagination controls
- **Export functionality**: Tests CSV and PDF export capabilities
- **Advanced search**: Tests advanced search options and JSON field searching
- **Real-time updates**: Validates live data updates and loading states
- **User experience**: Tests overall usability and interface responsiveness

## Running the Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run unit tests
php artisan test tests/Unit/AuditServiceTest.php
php artisan test tests/Unit/SecurityMonitoringServiceTest.php

# Run feature tests
php artisan test tests/Feature/AuditLogCreationTest.php
php artisan test tests/Feature/AuditLogRetrievalTest.php
php artisan test tests/Feature/SecurityMonitoringIntegrationTest.php

# Run browser tests (requires Dusk setup)
php artisan dusk tests/Browser/AuditLogManagementTest.php
```

### Complete Test Suite

```bash
# Run all audit-related tests
php artisan test --filter="Audit"

# Run all security monitoring tests
php artisan test --filter="Security"

# Run complete test suite
php artisan test
```

## Test Data Requirements

### Database Setup
- Requires fresh database migration for each test
- Uses factory-generated test data
- Requires proper role and permission setup

### External Dependencies
- Mock services for external integrations
- Notification system mocking for alert tests
- Cache system mocking for performance tests

## Performance Considerations

### Test Optimization
- Uses database transactions for faster test execution
- Implements proper test isolation
- Minimizes external service calls through mocking

### Bulk Operation Testing
- Tests handle large datasets efficiently
- Validates performance under high load
- Ensures memory usage remains reasonable

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing naming conventions
2. Ensure proper test isolation
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Document complex test scenarios

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Maintain backward compatibility
2. Update documentation when changing test behavior
3. Ensure all related tests still pass
4. Consider impact on CI/CD pipeline

## Continuous Integration

### Test Execution
- All tests run automatically on code changes
- Browser tests run in headless mode
- Test results integrated with deployment pipeline

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for audit components
- 100% coverage for critical security functions
- Regular coverage reports generated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database conflicts**: Ensure proper test isolation and cleanup
2. **Role/permission errors**: Verify test user setup
3. **Browser test failures**: Check Dusk configuration and browser drivers
4. **Mock service issues**: Verify mock setup and expectations

### Debug Tools
- Use `--verbose` flag for detailed test output
