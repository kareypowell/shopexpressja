# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the current role management system to provide a more scalable and maintainable approach to user role creation and permission checking. Currently, the system relies on hardcoded role IDs (e.g., role_id=3 for superadmin), which is not scalable as new roles are added. The enhancement will introduce role-based permission checking using role names/slugs and provide administrative interfaces for creating users with specific roles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create new users and assign them specific roles (admin, purchaser, etc.), so that I can manage user access without requiring database manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the user creation interface THEN the system SHALL display a form with role selection options
2. WHEN creating a new user THEN the system SHALL allow selection from available roles including admin, purchaser, customer, and superadmin
3. WHEN a user is created with a specific role THEN the system SHALL properly assign the role and send appropriate welcome notifications
4. WHEN an administrator views the user list THEN the system SHALL display each user's assigned role clearly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to check user permissions using role names instead of hardcoded IDs, so that the codebase is more maintainable and readable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking if a user has a specific role THEN the system SHALL support role name-based checking (e.g., hasRole('superadmin'))
2. WHEN checking permissions in policies or middleware THEN the system SHALL use descriptive role methods instead of ID comparisons
3. WHEN new roles are added to the database THEN existing permission checks SHALL continue to work without code changes
4. WHEN role names are used in code THEN the system SHALL be case-insensitive for role matching

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage existing user roles, so that I can update permissions as organizational needs change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator edits a user THEN the system SHALL allow changing the user's role
2. WHEN a user's role is changed THEN the system SHALL immediately update their permissions
3. WHEN viewing user details THEN the system SHALL display the current role and allow role modification
4. WHEN a role change occurs THEN the system SHALL log the change for audit purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want role-based helper methods on the User model, so that permission checking is consistent across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking user roles in controllers THEN the system SHALL provide methods like isAdmin(), isSuperAdmin(), isPurchaser()
2. WHEN checking permissions in Blade templates THEN the system SHALL support role-based conditionals
3. WHEN multiple role checks are needed THEN the system SHALL provide efficient methods to check multiple roles at once
4. WHEN role methods are called THEN the system SHALL cache role information to avoid repeated database queries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want navigation links for user and role management in the sidebar, so that I can easily access these administrative functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator views the sidebar navigation THEN the system SHALL display user management links including create user, manage users, and user statistics
2. WHEN a superadmin views the sidebar navigation THEN the system SHALL display role management links including manage roles, role assignments, and role audit trail
3. WHEN a user without appropriate permissions views the sidebar THEN role and user management links SHALL be hidden
4. WHEN navigation links are clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate management interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure data integrity during role management, so that existing functionality continues to work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the role system THEN existing user role assignments SHALL remain intact
2. WHEN migrating from ID-based to name-based role checking THEN all existing tests SHALL pass or be updated appropriately
3. WHEN role management is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during transition
4. WHEN unrealistic test conditions exist THEN they SHALL be updated to reflect actual business scenarios
