# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The backup management system will provide comprehensive data protection for the ShipSharkLtd application, including automated and manual backup capabilities for both database and file storage. The system will enable administrators to create, manage, and restore backups to ensure business continuity and data integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create manual database backups, so that I can ensure data is preserved before major system changes or maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator triggers a manual backup THEN the system SHALL create a complete MySQL database dump as a .sql file
2. WHEN creating a backup THEN the system SHALL include a timestamp in the filename for easy identification
3. WHEN a backup is created THEN the system SHALL store it in a designated backup directory with proper permissions
4. WHEN a backup fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the administrator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to schedule automated database backups, so that data is regularly protected without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring automated backups THEN the system SHALL allow setting backup frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
2. WHEN automated backup runs THEN the system SHALL create database dumps with timestamped filenames
3. WHEN automated backup completes THEN the system SHALL log the success and file location
4. WHEN automated backup fails THEN the system SHALL retry once and notify administrators of failures
5. WHEN backup storage exceeds retention policy THEN the system SHALL automatically remove old backup files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to backup critical file storage directories, so that uploaded files and generated documents are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a file backup THEN the system SHALL backup storage/app/public/pre-alerts directory
2. WHEN creating a file backup THEN the system SHALL backup storage/app/public/receipts directory
3. WHEN creating file backups THEN the system SHALL create compressed archives with timestamps
4. WHEN file backup completes THEN the system SHALL verify archive integrity
5. WHEN file backup fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and notify administrators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to restore the database from a backup file, so that I can recover from data corruption or system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a backup file THEN the system SHALL validate the .sql file format and integrity
2. WHEN restoring a database THEN the system SHALL create a pre-restore backup automatically
3. WHEN database restore begins THEN the system SHALL put the application in maintenance mode
4. WHEN database restore completes THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity and remove maintenance mode
5. WHEN restore fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and restore the pre-restore backup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to restore file storage from backup archives, so that I can recover lost or corrupted files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting a file backup archive THEN the system SHALL validate archive integrity
2. WHEN restoring files THEN the system SHALL create a backup of current files before restoration
3. WHEN file restore begins THEN the system SHALL extract files to their original locations
4. WHEN file restore completes THEN the system SHALL verify file permissions and ownership
5. WHEN file restore fails THEN the system SHALL restore the pre-restore file backup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage backup retention policies, so that storage space is efficiently utilized while maintaining adequate backup history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring retention THEN the system SHALL allow setting different retention periods for database and file backups
2. WHEN retention policy runs THEN the system SHALL remove backups older than the specified period
3. WHEN removing old backups THEN the system SHALL log which files were deleted
4. WHEN retention policy fails THEN the system SHALL log errors but continue with remaining cleanup
5. WHEN storage space is low THEN the system SHALL warn administrators before automatic cleanup

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor backup status and history, so that I can ensure backup operations are functioning correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing backup dashboard THEN the system SHALL display recent backup status and timestamps
2. WHEN viewing backup history THEN the system SHALL show success/failure status for all backup attempts
3. WHEN backup operations run THEN the system SHALL log detailed information including file sizes and duration
4. WHEN backup storage usage is high THEN the system SHALL display warnings on the dashboard
5. WHEN backup failures occur THEN the system SHALL send email notifications to administrators

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to export and download backup files, so that I can store copies offsite or transfer them to other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting backup download THEN the system SHALL provide secure download links for backup files
2. WHEN downloading backups THEN the system SHALL log access for security auditing
3. WHEN backup files are large THEN the system SHALL support resumable downloads
4. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL allow selecting multiple backup files for batch download
5. WHEN download links expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for new download requests
