# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement enhanced error handling in EnhancedManifestSummary component
  - Add comprehensive try-catch blocks around all data operations in calculateSummary method
  - Implement component-level error state properties (hasError, errorMessage, isRetrying)
  - Create handleCalculationError method to process and categorize different error types
  - Add retryCalculation method to allow users to retry failed operations
  - Create getEmergencyFallbackData method to provide minimal safe data when all else fails
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 4.2_

- [x] 2. Improve data validation and sanitization in summary calculation

  - Create data sanitization functions for string and array values
  - Add validation for required properties in manifest and package objects
  - Implement progressive data validation that allows partial rendering with warnings
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2, 3.4, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Enhance ManifestSummaryService error handling and resilience
  - Wrap all calculation methods in try-catch blocks with specific exception types
  - Implement input validation for all service methods (getManifestSummary, calculateAirManifestSummary, calculateSeaManifestSummary)
  - Add detailed error context and logging in all exception handlers
  - Create safe fallback methods for when calculations fail
  - Implement data sanitization in validateSummaryData method
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Improve ManifestSummaryCacheService reliability and fallback handling
  - Add comprehensive error handling in getCachedDisplaySummary method
  - Implement cache health monitoring and availability detection
  - Create graceful degradation when cache operations fail
  - Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated cache failures
  - Implement cache warming strategies for critical manifests
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Create error state UI components and user feedback
  - Design error state template section in enhanced-manifest-summary.blade.php
  - Add retry button functionality for failed calculations
  - Implement loading states and progress indicators
  - Create user-friendly error messages that don't expose technical details
  - Add graceful degradation UI that shows partial data when available
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
  - Add structured error logging with manifest ID, user context, and error details
  - Implement performance logging for calculation times and cache hit rates
  - Create monitoring for component failure rates and recovery success
  - Add contextual logging that helps with debugging production issues
  - Implement log sanitization to prevent sensitive data exposure
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 7. Add defensive programming to weight and volume calculation services
  - Implement input validation in WeightCalculationService and VolumeCalculationService
  - Add error handling for edge cases like empty package collections
  - Create safe fallback values for when calculations cannot be performed
  - Implement data validation for calculation results before returning
  - Add logging for calculation failures and data quality issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive error recovery testing
  - Write unit tests for all error scenarios in EnhancedManifestSummary component
  - Create integration tests for service failure recovery
  - Implement tests for cache failure scenarios and fallback behavior
  - Add tests for data validation and sanitization functions
  - Create performance tests for error handling overhead
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement component isolation to prevent page-wide failures
  - Ensure component errors don't affect parent page rendering
  - Add error boundaries around the component inclusion in manifest views
  - Implement graceful component failure that maintains page functionality
  - Create fallback rendering when component cannot load
  - Add component health checks and status indicators
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 10. Add production monitoring and alerting
  - Implement health check endpoints for component and service status
  - Create monitoring dashboards for error rates and performance metrics
  - Add alerting for critical component failures
  - Implement automated recovery mechanisms where possible
  - Create diagnostic tools for troubleshooting production issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_
