# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Manifest Summary Livewire component is causing blank screens when the `/livewire/message/manifests.enhanced-manifest-summary` endpoint is called. This issue prevents users from seeing the Package Status Legend, Manifest summary, and tab containers on the manifest packages screen. The component returns an empty response instead of the expected summary data, breaking the user interface and making the manifest management system unusable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the manifest summary to display correctly so that I can view package statistics and manage manifests effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the manifest packages screen loads THEN the Enhanced Manifest Summary component SHALL render without causing a blank screen
2. WHEN the component calculates summary data THEN it SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback data
3. WHEN the Livewire endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return valid JSON response with summary information
4. IF calculation errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the error and display a user-friendly message instead of a blank screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see accurate manifest statistics so that I can make informed decisions about package management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component loads THEN it SHALL display package count, total value, and appropriate metrics (weight for air, volume for sea)
2. WHEN manifest data is incomplete THEN the component SHALL show appropriate warnings without breaking the interface
3. WHEN the component refreshes THEN it SHALL update data without causing screen blanks
4. IF the manifest type is unknown THEN the component SHALL display basic information without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including manifest ID and error context
2. WHEN cache operations fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to direct calculation without breaking the interface
3. WHEN service dependencies are unavailable THEN the component SHALL provide safe fallback data
4. IF data validation fails THEN the system SHALL sanitize data and continue rendering with warnings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the manifest interface to remain functional even when there are data issues so that I can continue working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Enhanced Manifest Summary fails THEN other page components (tabs, legend, etc.) SHALL remain visible and functional
2. WHEN summary calculation fails THEN the component SHALL display an error state with retry option
3. WHEN network issues occur THEN the component SHALL show appropriate loading states and error messages
4. IF the component cannot render THEN it SHALL fail gracefully without affecting the entire page layout
