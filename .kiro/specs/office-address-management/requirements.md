# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will provide comprehensive management capabilities for Offices and Shipping Addresses within the ShipSharkLtd system. Currently, the Office and Address models exist but lack administrative interfaces for CRUD operations. This enhancement will enable administrators to manage office locations and shipping addresses through dedicated web interfaces accessible via the sidebar navigation.
