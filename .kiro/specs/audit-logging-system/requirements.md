# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Audit and Logging System will provide comprehensive tracking and monitoring of all user activities and system events throughout the ShipSharkLtd application. This feature will enable administrators to maintain security, compliance, and operational oversight by capturing detailed logs of user actions, system changes, and business-critical events. The system will include an intuitive administrative interface for viewing, searching, and managing audit logs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to automatically capture all user activities and system events, so that I can maintain a complete audit trail for security and compliance purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any CRUD operation on critical models (User, Package, Manifest, ConsolidatedPackage, etc.) THEN the system SHALL log the action with complete details
2. WHEN a user logs in or logs out THEN the system SHALL record authentication events with timestamp and IP address
3. WHEN a user changes their role or permissions THEN the system SHALL log the role change with before/after values
4. WHEN package status changes occur THEN the system SHALL capture the status transition with user context
5. WHEN financial transactions are processed THEN the system SHALL log all transaction details and calculations
6. WHEN manifest operations (lock/unlock, creation, modification) occur THEN the system SHALL record the manifest changes
7. WHEN consolidation/unconsolidation actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log package grouping changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to access a dedicated audit log management interface, so that I can efficiently review and analyze system activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Administration menu THEN I SHALL see an "Audit Logs" option
2. WHEN I access the audit logs interface THEN I SHALL see a paginated list of all audit entries
3. WHEN I view audit log entries THEN I SHALL see timestamp, user, action type, affected model, and change details
4. WHEN I need to search logs THEN I SHALL be able to filter by date range, user, action type, and model type
5. WHEN I view log details THEN I SHALL see before/after values for data changes
6. WHEN I export audit data THEN I SHALL be able to download filtered results as CSV or PDF

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure audit log retention and cleanup policies, so that I can manage storage space while maintaining compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring audit settings THEN I SHALL be able to set retention periods for different log types
2. WHEN retention periods expire THEN the system SHALL automatically archive or delete old logs
3. WHEN storage thresholds are reached THEN I SHALL receive notifications about log cleanup needs
4. WHEN critical events occur THEN those logs SHALL be marked for extended retention regardless of standard policies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to monitor suspicious activities and receive alerts, so that I can quickly respond to potential security threats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple failed login attempts occur THEN the system SHALL flag suspicious activity
2. WHEN unauthorized access attempts are made THEN the system SHALL log and alert administrators
3. WHEN bulk operations are performed THEN the system SHALL record and highlight these activities
4. WHEN sensitive data is accessed or modified THEN the system SHALL create high-priority audit entries
5. WHEN unusual activity patterns are detected THEN I SHALL receive email notifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to generate audit reports for regulatory purposes, so that I can demonstrate system accountability and data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating compliance reports THEN I SHALL be able to select specific date ranges and activity types
2. WHEN creating audit reports THEN the system SHALL include user actions, data changes, and system events
3. WHEN exporting reports THEN I SHALL receive formatted documents suitable for regulatory submission
4. WHEN reviewing data integrity THEN I SHALL see complete change histories for critical business objects
5. WHEN auditing user permissions THEN I SHALL see all role changes and access modifications over time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system user, I want my activities to be logged transparently without impacting system performance, so that audit logging doesn't interfere with my daily work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform normal operations THEN audit logging SHALL not cause noticeable performance degradation
2. WHEN audit events are captured THEN they SHALL be processed asynchronously to avoid blocking user actions
3. WHEN the audit system experiences issues THEN my normal application functionality SHALL continue uninterrupted
4. WHEN viewing my own activity history THEN I SHALL be able to see my recent actions (if permitted by role)
