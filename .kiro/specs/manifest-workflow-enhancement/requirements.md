# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the manifest management system by improving navigation structure and implementing a comprehensive package workflow system. The enhancement includes updating the sidebar navigation to match the customer management pattern, creating a streamlined process for managing packages through various stages (pending, processing, shipped, customs, ready, delivered), implementing package distribution with receipt generation and transaction logging, and normalizing package status across the entire system with database seeders for existing entries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want an improved manifest navigation structure similar to the customer management section, so that I can easily access all manifest-related functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the sidebar navigation THEN the system SHALL display a "Manifests" section with expandable sub-items
2. WHEN I expand the Manifests section THEN the system SHALL show "All Manifests" and "Create Manifest" options
3. WHEN I click "All Manifests" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the manifest listing page
4. WHEN I click "Create Manifest" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the manifest creation page
5. IF I am on any manifest-related page THEN the system SHALL highlight the appropriate navigation item

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to manage packages through different workflow stages, so that I can track and update package status efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a manifest THEN the system SHALL display packages with their current status (pending, processing, shipped, customs, ready, delivered, delayed)
2. WHEN I select one or more packages THEN the system SHALL allow me to update their status to the next appropriate stage
3. WHEN I update package status THEN the system SHALL validate that the status transition is valid
4. WHEN a package status changes THEN the system SHALL log the status change with timestamp and user information
5. IF a package is in "ready" status THEN the system SHALL enable distribution functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to add packages to manifests through a smooth process, so that I can efficiently organize shipments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create or edit a manifest THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive interface to add packages
2. WHEN I add packages to a manifest THEN the system SHALL validate package information and availability
3. WHEN packages are added to a manifest THEN the system SHALL update the manifest totals and package counts
4. WHEN I save a manifest with packages THEN the system SHALL persist all package associations
5. IF a package is already assigned to another active manifest THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate assignment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to distribute packages to customers with receipt generation, so that I can complete the delivery process with proper documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select packages with "ready" status THEN the system SHALL enable the distribution function
2. WHEN I initiate package distribution THEN the system SHALL allow me to enter the amount collected from the customer
3. WHEN I enter the collection amount THEN the system SHALL calculate payment status (paid, partial, unpaid) based on total package costs
4. WHEN I complete distribution THEN the system SHALL generate a receipt with package details, costs, amount collected, and payment status
5. WHEN a receipt is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically email the receipt to the customer
6. WHEN distribution is completed THEN the system SHALL update package status to "delivered"
7. WHEN distribution occurs THEN the system SHALL log the transaction with receipt details, payment information, timestamp, and user information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want comprehensive transaction logging for all package operations, so that I can maintain an audit trail and track system activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any package status changes THEN the system SHALL log the change with user, timestamp, old status, and new status
2. WHEN packages are distributed THEN the system SHALL log the distribution event with customer, package details, and receipt information
3. WHEN receipts are generated THEN the system SHALL log the receipt creation with recipient and content details
4. WHEN I view package history THEN the system SHALL display all logged activities in chronological order
5. IF system errors occur during operations THEN the system SHALL log error details for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive automated email notifications with receipts, so that I have documentation of my package deliveries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my packages are distributed THEN the system SHALL automatically send me an email with the receipt
2. WHEN I receive the receipt email THEN it SHALL contain all package details, costs, and delivery information
3. WHEN the receipt is emailed THEN it SHALL be formatted professionally with company branding
4. IF email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and allow manual resend
5. WHEN I receive the email THEN it SHALL include a PDF attachment of the receipt for my records
### Req
uirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all package statuses normalized to use consistent values across the entire system with database seeders for existing entries, so that there is no confusion or inconsistency in status reporting and management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is updated THEN all package status values SHALL use a standardized enum with values: pending, processing, shipped, customs, ready, delivered, delayed
2. WHEN the status normalization seeder runs THEN it SHALL identify all unique status values currently in the packages table and map them to appropriate normalized status values
3. WHEN existing database entries are migrated THEN all current status values SHALL be updated to use the normalized status format with a summary report of changes
4. WHEN I view any package in the system THEN the status SHALL display using the normalized status values with consistent styling across all components
5. WHEN new packages are created THEN they SHALL only use the normalized status values with proper validation
6. WHEN status transitions are made THEN the system SHALL validate that the transition is logically valid using the centralized enum
7. IF legacy status values exist in historical data THEN they SHALL be displayed with their normalized equivalents for clarity
8. IF unmappable status values are found during migration THEN the system SHALL log them for manual review and set them to a default status
