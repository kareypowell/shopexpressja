# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the manifest management system by improving navigation structure and implementing a comprehensive package workflow system. The enhancement includes updating the sidebar navigation to match the customer management pattern, creating a streamlined process for managing packages through various stages (pending, processing, shipped, customs, ready, delivered), and implementing package distribution with receipt generation and transaction logging.

3. WHEN packages are added to a manifest THEN the system SHALL update the manifest totals and package counts
4. WHEN I save a manifest with packages THEN the system SHALL persist all package associations
5. IF a package is already assigned to another active manifest THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate assignment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to distribute packages to customers with receipt generation, so that I can complete the delivery process with proper documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select packages with "ready" status THEN the system SHALL enable the distribution function
2. WHEN I initiate package distribution THEN the system SHALL allow me to enter the amount collected from the customer
3. WHEN I enter the collection amount THEN the system SHALL calculate payment status (paid, partial, unpaid) based on total package costs
4. WHEN I complete distribution THEN the system SHALL generate a receipt with package details, costs, amount collected, and payment status
5. WHEN a receipt is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically email the receipt to the customer
6. WHEN distribution is completed THEN the system SHALL update package status to "delivered"
7. WHEN distribution occurs THEN the system SHALL log the transaction with receipt details, payment information, timestamp, and user information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want comprehensive transaction logging for all package operations, so that I can maintain an audit trail and track system activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN packages are distributed THEN the system SHALL log the distribution event with customer, package details, and receipt information
3. WHEN receipts are generated THEN the system SHALL log the receipt creation with recipient and content details
4. WHEN I view package history THEN the system SHALL display all logged activities in chronological order
5. IF system errors occur during operations THEN the system SHALL log error details for troubleshooting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive automated email notifications with receipts, so that I have documentation of my package deliveries.

#### Acceptance Criteria
