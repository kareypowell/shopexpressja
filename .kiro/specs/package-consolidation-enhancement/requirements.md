# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces package consolidation functionality that allows administrators to group multiple packages under a single consolidated entry while maintaining detailed tracking records for each individual package. This optional feature provides flexibility in package management, similar to existing Sea package functionality, and ensures that all notifications and communications are updated to reflect the consolidated status when enabled.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to consolidate multiple packages into a single entry, so that I can simplify package management while maintaining detailed tracking records.

2. WHEN consolidation mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL allow me to select multiple packages for consolidation
3. WHEN I select packages for consolidation THEN the system SHALL validate that packages belong to the same customer
4. WHEN I consolidate packages THEN the system SHALL create a consolidated package entry with combined totals
5. WHEN packages are consolidated THEN the system SHALL maintain individual tracking numbers, quantities, weights, and descriptions as sub-items
6. WHEN viewing a consolidated package THEN the system SHALL display both the consolidated summary and individual package details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to toggle package consolidation on or off, so that I can choose when to use this feature based on operational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access package management THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle switch to enable/disable consolidation mode
2. WHEN consolidation mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL display packages individually as normal
3. WHEN consolidation mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL show consolidation options and consolidated packages
4. WHEN I toggle consolidation mode THEN the system SHALL remember my preference for the current session
5. WHEN consolidation mode is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this status in the interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to maintain detailed tracking information for consolidated packages, so that I can access individual package data when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packages are consolidated THEN the system SHALL preserve original tracking numbers for each package
2. WHEN packages are consolidated THEN the system SHALL maintain individual package quantities and weights
3. WHEN packages are consolidated THEN the system SHALL preserve individual package descriptions
4. WHEN viewing consolidated package details THEN the system SHALL display a breakdown of all individual packages
5. WHEN I need to reference individual packages THEN the system SHALL allow me to expand consolidated entries to see sub-items
6. WHEN consolidated packages are processed THEN the system SHALL update status for all individual packages within the consolidation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want consolidated packages to calculate totals automatically, so that I can see accurate combined weights, costs, and quantities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packages are consolidated THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate total weight from all individual packages
2. WHEN packages are consolidated THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate total quantity from all individual packages
3. WHEN packages are consolidated THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate total costs (freight, customs, storage, delivery fees)
4. WHEN individual package costs change THEN the system SHALL automatically update consolidated totals
5. WHEN viewing consolidated packages THEN the system SHALL display both individual and total values clearly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to unconsolidate packages when needed, so that I can separate packages that were previously consolidated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a consolidated package THEN the system SHALL provide an option to unconsolidate the packages
2. WHEN I choose to unconsolidate THEN the system SHALL restore individual package entries with their original data
3. WHEN packages are unconsolidated THEN the system SHALL maintain all historical tracking and status information
4. WHEN unconsolidation occurs THEN the system SHALL remove the consolidated entry and restore individual package visibility
5. WHEN packages are unconsolidated THEN the system SHALL preserve any status changes that occurred while consolidated

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive updated notifications that reflect package consolidation, so that I understand when my packages are being managed as a group.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN my packages are consolidated THEN the system SHALL send me a notification about the consolidation
2. WHEN consolidated packages change status THEN the system SHALL send notifications that reference the consolidated group
3. WHEN I receive notifications about consolidated packages THEN they SHALL include details about all individual packages in the group
4. WHEN consolidated packages are ready for pickup THEN the system SHALL send a single notification covering all packages

2. WHEN I distribute consolidated packages THEN the system SHALL generate a single receipt that itemizes all individual packages
3. WHEN consolidated packages are distributed THEN the system SHALL update the status of all individual packages to delivered
4. WHEN calculating distribution costs THEN the system SHALL use the consolidated totals for payment processing
5. WHEN generating distribution receipts THEN the system SHALL show both consolidated totals and individual package breakdowns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want consolidated packages to integrate with existing manifest workflows, so that consolidation works within current operational processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding consolidated packages to manifests THEN the system SHALL treat them as single entries for manifest purposes
2. WHEN consolidated packages are in manifests THEN the system SHALL show consolidated totals for manifest calculations
3. WHEN processing manifest packages THEN the system SHALL allow status updates for entire consolidated groups
4. WHEN viewing manifest details THEN the system SHALL provide options to expand consolidated packages to see individual items
5. WHEN consolidated packages move through workflow stages THEN all individual packages SHALL maintain synchronized status

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consolidated packages to maintain data integrity, so that no tracking information is lost during consolidation operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packages are consolidated THEN the system SHALL create audit logs of the consolidation action
2. WHEN consolidated packages are modified THEN the system SHALL log all changes with timestamps and user information
3. WHEN packages are unconsolidated THEN the system SHALL verify that all original data is restored correctly
4. WHEN system errors occur during consolidation THEN the system SHALL prevent data loss and provide error recovery options
5. WHEN viewing package history THEN the system SHALL show consolidation and unconsolidation events in the timeline

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want consolidated packages to work with existing search and filtering, so that I can find consolidated packages using current tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria
