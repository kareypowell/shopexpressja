# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the manifest management system by implementing a manifest locking mechanism that controls when package details can be edited, automatically closes manifests when all packages are delivered, and provides the ability to unlock closed manifests with proper authorization and audit trail. The enhancement ensures data integrity while maintaining operational flexibility for legitimate business needs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to edit package details only when a manifest is open, so that I can maintain data integrity while allowing necessary updates during active manifest processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a manifest with `is_open` set to true THEN the system SHALL allow me to edit package details
2. WHEN I view a manifest with `is_open` set to false THEN the system SHALL prevent all editing of package details and manifest information
3. WHEN I view a closed manifest THEN the system SHALL display the manifest and package information in read-only mode
4. WHEN I attempt to edit any details on a closed manifest THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating the manifest is locked
5. WHEN a manifest is open THEN the system SHALL display visual indicators showing that editing is allowed
6. WHEN a manifest is closed THEN the system SHALL hide all edit buttons, forms, and modification controls
7. IF I have appropriate permissions THEN the system SHALL show package edit controls only for open manifests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want manifests to automatically close when all packages are delivered, so that completed manifests are protected from accidental modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all packages in a manifest have status "delivered" THEN the system SHALL automatically set `is_open` to false
2. WHEN a package status changes to "delivered" THEN the system SHALL check if all other packages in the same manifest are also delivered
3. WHEN the last package in a manifest is marked as delivered THEN the system SHALL update the manifest `is_open` field to false
4. WHEN a manifest is automatically closed THEN the system SHALL log the closure event with timestamp and triggering package
5. IF a manifest has no packages THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically close the manifest

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to unlock closed manifests with a valid reason, so that I can make necessary corrections or updates when business requirements demand it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a closed manifest THEN the system SHALL display only an "Unlock" button in the Actions section (no other action buttons)
2. WHEN I click the "Unlock" button THEN the system SHALL prompt me to enter a reason for unlocking
3. WHEN I provide a valid reason THEN the system SHALL set `is_open` to true and log the unlock action
4. WHEN I unlock a manifest THEN the system SHALL record my user ID, timestamp, and the reason provided
5. WHEN a manifest is unlocked THEN the system SHALL restore all editing capabilities and display success confirmation
6. WHEN a manifest is unlocked THEN the system SHALL send a notification to relevant stakeholders
7. IF I don't provide a reason THEN the system SHALL prevent the unlock action and display an error message
8. IF I don't have appropriate permissions THEN the system SHALL hide the unlock button

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive audit logging for all manifest locking operations, so that I can track who made changes and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a manifest is automatically closed THEN the system SHALL log the event with package details and timestamp
2. WHEN a manifest is manually unlocked THEN the system SHALL log the user, reason, and timestamp
3. WHEN I view manifest history THEN the system SHALL display all locking/unlocking events in chronological order
4. WHEN audit logs are created THEN they SHALL include sufficient detail for compliance and troubleshooting
5. IF system errors occur during locking operations THEN the system SHALL log error details for investigation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want clear visual indicators of manifest status, so that I can quickly understand whether a manifest is open or closed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a manifest list THEN the system SHALL display the open/closed status with clear visual indicators
2. WHEN I view an individual manifest THEN the system SHALL prominently display whether it's open or closed
3. WHEN a manifest is closed THEN the system SHALL use distinct styling to indicate locked status
4. WHEN a manifest is open THEN the system SHALL use distinct styling to indicate editable status
5. IF a manifest was recently unlocked THEN the system SHALL display additional context about the unlock action
