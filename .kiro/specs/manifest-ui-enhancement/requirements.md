# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the user interface of the Manifest Packages and Package Workflow pages by implementing a tabbed interface to organize content better and updating the summary section to display appropriate metrics based on manifest type. The enhancement addresses the issue of pages becoming too long by consolidating the Consolidated Packages and Individual Packages sections into tabs, and improves the summary display by showing weight information for Air manifests and volume information for Sea manifests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the Consolidated Packages and Individual Packages sections organized in a tabbed interface, so that I can easily switch between views without scrolling through long pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the Manifest Packages page THEN the system SHALL display Consolidated Packages and Individual Packages sections in separate tabs
2. WHEN I click on the "Consolidated Packages" tab THEN the system SHALL show only the consolidated packages view with all related functionality
3. WHEN I click on the "Individual Packages" tab THEN the system SHALL show only the individual packages view with all related functionality
4. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain the current state of filters, selections, and pagination within each tab
5. IF I have packages selected in one tab THEN switching tabs SHALL preserve those selections when I return to the original tab

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the Package Workflow page to use the same tabbed interface, so that I have a consistent experience across both manifest-related pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the Package Workflow page THEN the system SHALL display the same tabbed interface as the Manifest Packages page
2. WHEN I perform workflow actions in one tab THEN the system SHALL update the appropriate packages and maintain tab state
3. WHEN I switch between tabs on the workflow page THEN the system SHALL preserve any active workflow selections or operations
4. WHEN workflow operations complete THEN the system SHALL refresh the appropriate tab content without losing tab focus
5. IF I have workflow operations in progress THEN switching tabs SHALL not interrupt the operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the summary section to display weight in pounds and kilograms for Air manifests, so that I can see the relevant shipping metrics for air transportation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view an Air manifest summary THEN the system SHALL display total weight in pounds (lbs)
2. WHEN I view an Air manifest summary THEN the system SHALL display total weight in kilograms (kg) alongside the pounds
3. WHEN the weight is displayed THEN the system SHALL show both units with proper formatting (e.g., "150.5 lbs (68.3 kg)")
4. WHEN packages are added or removed from an Air manifest THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate and update the weight totals
5. IF weight data is missing for some packages THEN the system SHALL indicate incomplete weight information and show totals for available data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the summary section to display volume in cubic feet for Sea manifests, so that I can see the relevant shipping metrics for sea transportation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a Sea manifest summary THEN the system SHALL display total volume in cubic feet
2. WHEN the volume is displayed THEN the system SHALL show proper formatting with decimal places (e.g., "45.75 cubic feet")
3. WHEN packages are added or removed from a Sea manifest THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate and update the volume totals
4. WHEN I view the volume information THEN the system SHALL display it prominently in the summary section
5. IF volume data is missing for some packages THEN the system SHALL indicate incomplete volume information and show totals for available data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the tabbed interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the tabbed interface on mobile devices THEN the tabs SHALL be properly sized and touchable
2. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN I SHALL be able to navigate between tabs using arrow keys
3. WHEN I use screen readers THEN the tab interface SHALL provide proper accessibility labels and announcements
4. WHEN the screen size is small THEN the tabs SHALL stack or scroll horizontally as appropriate
5. IF the tab content is long THEN each tab SHALL maintain its own scroll position independently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the tab state to be preserved in the URL, so that I can bookmark specific tab views and share links with colleagues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a tab THEN the URL SHALL update to reflect the active tab
2. WHEN I bookmark or share a URL with a tab parameter THEN opening that URL SHALL display the correct tab
3. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the system SHALL maintain the previously selected tab
4. WHEN I navigate back/forward in browser history THEN the system SHALL restore the appropriate tab state
5. IF an invalid tab is specified in the URL THEN the system SHALL default to the first tab and update the URL accordingly
