# Manifest Linking Implementation - Complete

## Summary
All transactions are now automatically linked to manifests when created during package distribution.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Model - Transaction Methods Updated
Added `$manifestId` parameter to all transaction recording methods:

**app/Models/User.php:**
- `recordCharge()` - Added `$manifestId = null` parameter
- `recordPayment()` - Added `$manifestId = null` parameter  
- `recordWriteOff()` - Added `$manifestId = null` parameter

All methods now include `'manifest_id' => $manifestId` when creating transactions.

### 2. PackageDistributionService - Manifest ID Passed
Updated all transaction creation calls to pass manifest_id:

**app/Services/PackageDistributionService.php:**
- Gets `$manifestId` from first package in distribution
- Passes `$manifestId` to all `recordCharge()` calls
- Passes `$manifestId` to all `recordPayment()` calls
- Passes `$manifestId` to all `recordWriteOff()` calls

### 3. Existing Transactions Linked
Ran command to link existing unlinked transactions:
- **Linked:** 8 transactions to their respective manifests
- **Total linked:** 36 out of 39 transactions now have manifest_id
- **Remaining unlinked:** 3 transactions (for user with no packages)

## How It Works

### During Package Distribution:
```php
// 1. Get manifest from packages
$manifestId = $packages->first()->manifest_id;

// 2. Create charge transaction with manifest_id
$customer->recordCharge(
    $amount,
    $description,
    $userId,
    'package_distribution',
    $distributionId,
    $metadata,
    $manifestId  // ← Automatically linked!
);
```

### Result:
Every transaction created during distribution is automatically linked to the manifest, enabling:
- ✅ Accurate "WRITTEN OFF" column in reports
- ✅ Proper outstanding balance calculations
- ✅ Manifest-specific financial tracking
- ✅ Daily write-offs chart data

## Verification

### Check Transaction Linking:
```bash
php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Check latest transactions
$recent = \App\Models\CustomerTransaction::latest()->take(5)->get(['id', 'type', 'manifest_id', 'description']);
foreach ($recent as $t) {
    echo "ID: {$t->id}, Type: {$t->type}, Manifest: " . ($t->manifest_id ?? 'NULL') . "\n";
}
```

### Expected Result:
All new transactions should have `manifest_id` populated.

## Commands Available

### Link All Unlinked Transactions:
```bash
php artisan transactions:link-all-to-manifests
```

### Check Linking Status:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="
echo 'Total: ' . \App\Models\CustomerTransaction::count() . PHP_EOL;
echo 'Linked: ' . \App\Models\CustomerTransaction::whereNotNull('manifest_id')->count() . PHP_EOL;
echo 'Unlinked: ' . \App\Models\CustomerTransaction::whereNull('manifest_id')->count() . PHP_EOL;
"
```

## Files Modified
1. `app/Models/User.php` - Added manifest_id parameter to transaction methods
2. `app/Services/PackageDistributionService.php` - Pass manifest_id when creating transactions
3. `app/Console/Commands/LinkAllTransactionsToManifests.php` - New command to link existing transactions

## Testing
1. ✅ Distribute a package
2. ✅ Check the transaction has manifest_id
3. ✅ Verify it appears in Sales & Collections report
4. ✅ Create a write-off and verify it shows in "WRITTEN OFF" column

## Notes
- Manifest ID is optional (defaults to null) for backward compatibility
- If packages don't have manifest_id, transactions won't be linked (but won't fail)
- Consolidated package distributions also link to manifests
- All transaction types (charge, payment, write_off) are linked
